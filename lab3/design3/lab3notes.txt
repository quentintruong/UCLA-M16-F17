Notes:

I have provided my lab1 and lab2 designs in the lab_modules.v file.  You can
feel free to use those, or replace them with your own, surely better, modules.
Make sure the file includes the adder, maxindex, display driver, multiplier, and
deserializer blocks.

3.1(b) Note that in order to chain 4-bit ripple-carry adders into a 16-bit
  adder, we'll need to pass in and out the relevant carry bits.  That wasn't
  required in lab 1; I've provided my version in the lab_modules.v file.

3.1(c) Note that in lab 2, we used unsigned integers.  In our neuron, we are
  multiplying an unsigned input with a signed weight, which may require some
  modification of your multiplier.  Again, my version in lab_modules.v includes
  this.

  Also note that the neuron bias b is a constant value, and so you don't need to
  worry about proper pipelining of that signal. 

3.2(b) This may or may not require any design on your part: if your pipeline
  already has the requisite throughput, you wouldn't need to change anything.

3.3(a) For the sake of debugging (as seen in the test-bench), I've added another
  output to the decoder module: the 5 bit letter index as output by the maxindex
  block.

EE89 lab:
  The weights are calibrated so that one Morse time unit is 4 clock cycles:
    dit = 4 clock cycles high
    dah = 12 clock cycles high
    space between pulses = 4 clock cycles low
    space between letters = 12 clock cycles low
